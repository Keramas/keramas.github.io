<b>CTF:</b><br />SECCON 2017<br /><br /><br /><b>Challenge:</b><br />Run Me!<br /><br /><b>Category:</b><br />Programming<br /><br /><img src="https://github.com/Keramas/CTF-Writeups/blob/master/Images/seccon2017/runme.png?raw=true" /><br /><br />If you immediately recognize this script as something that is familiar to you, you are right!<br />It's a script for getting the nth number of the Fibonacci sequence (with some other stuff for our flag). One problem though--the number we need for the flag is SUPER big and it would take waaaay too long for your computer to finish running this.<br /><br />While it's possible to optimize with memoize perhaps, luckily there are precomputed numbers already available on the net.<br /><br /><img src="https://github.com/Keramas/CTF-Writeups/blob/master/Images/seccon2017/largefib.png?raw=true" /><br /><br />So here is the number we need. Looking at the script though we only need the first 32 digits, so I sloppily copied a bunch of numbers, and then threw it into a script to get the flag.<br /><br /><img src="https://github.com/Keramas/CTF-Writeups/blob/master/Images/seccon2017/runmemodded.png?raw=true" /><br /><img src="https://github.com/Keramas/CTF-Writeups/blob/master/Images/seccon2017/runmeflag.png?raw=true" /><br /><br />====================================<br /><br /><b>Challenge:</b><br />Putchar Music<br /><br /><b>Category:</b><br />Programming<br /><br /><img src="https://github.com/Keramas/CTF-Writeups/blob/master/Images/seccon2017/putcharmusic_challenge.png?raw=true" /><br /><br />Using the challenge title as a hint, I was mind-blown to discover Algorithmic Music, which takes single-line C programs to generate cool tunes!<br /><br />The first step is to compile the code, and then use that file along with Sox to generate a .wav file that we can listen to.<br /><br /><img src="https://github.com/Keramas/CTF-Writeups/blob/master/Images/seccon2017/putcharmusic.png?raw=true" /><br /><br />Opening the wav file, it plays the iconic Star Wars theme song, which allows us to construct our flag:<br />SECCON{STAR_WARS}<br /><br />====================================<br /><br /><b>Challenge:</b><br />JPEG file<br /><br /><b>Category:</b><br />binary<br /><br /><img src="https://github.com/Keramas/CTF-Writeups/blob/master/Images/seccon2017/jpegfile_challenge.png?raw=true" /><br /><br />This challenge gives us a broken JPEG that does not display a proper image, and it's our job to fix it to reveal the flag.<br /><br />After playing detective in hexedit, I couldn't find anything wrong with the header, but using jpeginfo it guided me to the spot in the hex that needed to be edited.<br /><br /><img src="https://github.com/Keramas/CTF-Writeups/blob/master/Images/seccon2017/jpgbroken.png?raw=true" /><br /><br />Conducting some tests by changing the 0xFC value I found in hexedit, which is right where all the actual image data begins, I confirmed that it was indeed the location it was indicating, and turning this into 0x00 allowed the image to display properly.<br /><br /><img src="https://github.com/Keramas/CTF-Writeups/blob/master/Images/seccon2017/fixedjpg.png?raw=true" /><br /><br /><img src="https://github.com/Keramas/CTF-Writeups/blob/master/Images/seccon2017/brokenjpg_flag.png?raw=true" />
