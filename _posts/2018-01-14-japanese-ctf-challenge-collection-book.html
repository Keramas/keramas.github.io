While visiting Japan for a couple weeks for the holidays, I decided to stop into a bookstore and see what kind of info sec books were available in Japanese, and I came across this CTF challenge collection book written by the organizers of SECCON.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-diF6xUBhDRk/WlsUtm7DzSI/AAAAAAAAAbE/HZe6FzJU7W00IR_0jo109h_9JM1dgKAugCLcBGAs/s1600/ctfbook.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1202" data-original-width="1600" height="240" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-diF6xUBhDRk/WlsUtm7DzSI/AAAAAAAAAbE/HZe6FzJU7W00IR_0jo109h_9JM1dgKAugCLcBGAs/s320/ctfbook.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />I found it to be pretty neat. The required files are provided on the book's website, and there are walkthroughs as well as lessons on how to solve the challenges. I personally haven't seen any kind of book like this in English, so I'm looking forward to reading it and working through the challenges.<br /><br />If you can read Japanese or just want to check it out anyway, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%82%BB%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A5%E3%83%AA%E3%83%86%E3%82%A3%E3%82%B3%E3%83%B3%E3%83%86%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%81%AE%E3%81%9F%E3%82%81%E3%81%AECTF%E5%95%8F%E9%A1%8C%E9%9B%86-%E6%B8%85%E6%B0%B4-%E7%A5%90%E5%A4%AA%E9%83%8E/dp/4839962138">here is a link to the Amazon.jp listing</a>.
