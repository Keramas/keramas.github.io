Unplugging once in a while is something that can be incredibly difficult to do, especially for those who are professionals in the field yet still continue to hack away during non-work hours out of pure passion. However, the benefits of forcing yourself to get away from your computer, terminal, or whatever you are hacking on, are noticeable and aid in resetting the cache in your brain so it functions better. 

I am most definitely guilty of always being jacked into the Matrix, but I find that reading is a great way to unplug from everything--especailly since I am old school and still prefer to read books made of paper. Since hacker summercamp (safe mode) is right around the corner, I've procured a short summer reading list that aims to help people unplug a bit while still focusing on themes of hacking. I can't recommend these books enough--they are all fantastic reads!
